        "The aim of this part of the activity is to apply your understanding of Fully Connected Networks by implementing a multilayer network for the [Kaggle ASL (American Sign Language) dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/grassknoted/asl-alphabet). While you have been provided with a complete solution for a Fully Connected Network using Numpy for the MNIST dataset, you are encouraged to try to come up with the solution.\n",

        "\n",
        "    This activity requires submission in teams of 3 or 4 members. Submissions from smaller or larger teams will not be accepted unless prior approval has been granted (only due to exceptional circumstances). While teamwork is encouraged, each member is expected to contribute individually to the assignment. The final submission should feature the best arguments and solutions from each team member. Only one person per team needs to submit the completed work, but it is imperative that the names of all team members are listed in a Markdown cell at the very beginning of the notebook (either the first or second cell). Failure to include all team member names will result in the grade being awarded solely to the individual who submitted the assignment, with zero points given to other team members (no exceptions will be made to this rule).\n",

        "    Start Fresh: Although you can refer to the MNIST solution at any point, try to implement the network for the ASL dataset on your own. This will reinforce your learning and understanding of the architecture and mathematics involved.\n",

        "- `24` is the output layer, corresponding to the letters included in the dataset (excluding J and Z).\n",

        "\n",

        "\n",
        "The weights of the linear layers were initialized using `Kaiming He` initialization, which is well suited for networks employing `ReLU` activations.\n",
